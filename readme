# Better Than OBS 🎥

**Better Than OBS** is a screen recording application inspired by the popular OBS Studio, but built with a personal vision to include improvements and new features where I felt OBS fell short.

## 🚀 About the Project

I took inspiration from OBS Studio, but I’ve added my own ideas and enhancements in areas I believed needed improvement. That’s why I chose the name **Better Than OBS** — a bit bold, but meant in good humor.

I actually made this application to record the screen while listening to music. I don't want to add a ton of unnecessary features. The reason I claim it is better than OBS is because I didn't want to mess with the virtual audio system on my computer. OBS often requires complex configuration when trying to exclude specific application audio (like Spotify), which was frustrating. This app avoids all of that by keeping it simple and focused.

This project is still under development, and some parts are incomplete. I'm aware of the current bugs and missing features. In particular, the logging and debugging process took a lot of time, but I believe it helped build a more solid foundation.

## 🔧 Planned Features

- [x] Screen recording
- [x] Simple user interface
- [ ] Advanced debugging and logging system
- [ ] Feedback submission feature
- [ ] Backend integration with Firebase or a similar service for collecting feedback/help requests
- [ ] Dual "Help" section:
  - 1. A traditional help section to guide users
  - 2. A feedback system that will connect to a backend service in the future

## ❗️Notes

- You may currently see two similar "Help" options in the interface — this is intentional. One is planned to be a traditional guide, and the other will serve as a feedback tool connected to a backend system.
- Since the project is in **active development**, some parts of the code may be placeholders or incomplete.
