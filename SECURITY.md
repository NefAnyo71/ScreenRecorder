If the vulnerability affects audio privacy, screen content, or application permissions, please describe it in as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, OS version, etc.).

## 🛡 Philosophy

This project was built with simplicity and privacy in mind:

- No cloud syncing or hidden background services  
- No virtual audio routing or invasive system hooks  
- No unnecessary permissions or telemetry  
- Fully offline and open source

**You are in control of what gets recorded — and what doesn't.**

## 🔧 Security Goals (Planned)

- [ ] Add sandboxing or permission warnings for sensitive actions
- [ ] Add optional privacy prompts (e.g. “Do you want to record app audio?”)
- [ ] Make it easy to *exclude* apps like Spotify from recording
- [ ] Transparent handling of all data, with no external tracking

Thank you for helping make Better Than OBS safer and more reliable for everyone!
